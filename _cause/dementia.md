Dementia is a progressive decline in brain function, including the brain cells that control movement and swallowing. Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is the sixth leading cause of death for adults in the United States. However, [the actual number of deaths linked to dementia](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/death-certificates-may-not-adequately-report-dementia-cause-death) may be about three times greater than what is reported on U.S. death certificates.
