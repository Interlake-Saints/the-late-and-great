Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare condition with about 5,000 diagnosed cases per year and about 30,000 Americans living with the disease. The life expectancy of an ALS patient averages 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Only 20% of patients live longer than 5 years.

See the [ALS Foundation for Life](http://alsfoundation.org/learn/facts.htm) for more information.
