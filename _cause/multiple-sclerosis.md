Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the central nervous system. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems throughout your body. Life expectancy amongst people with MS is reduced by 7 to 14 years. At least 50% of patients die from MS directly-related causes.
