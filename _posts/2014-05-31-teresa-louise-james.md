Teresa, aka Terri Strain, worked in the tourism industry most of her life and enjoyed it very much. She excelled at almost everything she did. For many years, she suffered from poor health, and finally found peace on May 31, 2014 in Culver, Oregon. She was an avid Seahawks fan and her friends were so happy she got to see her beloved team win a Superbowl before she passed. Terri is survived by three grown daughters and four grandchildren.
