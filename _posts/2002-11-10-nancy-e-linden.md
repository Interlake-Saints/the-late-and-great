Nancy, aka Nancy Linden Richardson,was a loving, devoted wife. She adored and was proud of her children. She was the 'Queen of Crafts', an avid coupon clipper, loved a great 'sale', and was the elf with the bells. She truly enjoyed working with children. Throughout her ordeal with breast cancer- as well as the rest of her life, she glowed with her zeal for God. She shared her faith with all she met. She not only touched lives, she touched hearts. Nancy, Hunny Bunny, Mom, we all love you.

Nancy died November 10, 2002, of breast cancer at Harrison Hospital in Poulsbo. She was 43 years old.
