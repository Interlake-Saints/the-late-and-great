We all knew Robert Harris, who went by the nickname of "Hard Rob." He was that funny, quirky guy that always walked around with a smile on his face, or would take out his false tooth to get a laugh. He was part of the Interlake Varsity Basketball Team, and was also an All-State track star. He worked at the crossroads QFC for more than twenty years, and he never met a stranger. He was friends with everyone. 

I am humbled and saddened to announce Rob passed away of a heart attack on July 30, 2020. He has had tragedy in his life and, unfortunately, he did not have any other living family members to take care of him. He did have many people that loved him though, and the classes of 85-87 want to help our friend and classmate and give him a proper burial. We hope you all will join us and allow Rob to lay in peace with the respect and dignity that he deserves. He would have done it for any of us. All money raised will go to assuring that Robert has a proper burial with a headstone. Any leftover funds will be donated to the homeless shelters of Seattle.
