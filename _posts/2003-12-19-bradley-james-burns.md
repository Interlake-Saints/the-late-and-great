Brad was a much loved son, brother, son-in-law and brother in law, treasured friend and gifted colleague. His energetic spirit, friendly manner and witty personality warmed the hearts of all those who had the pleasure of knowing and loving him. Brad was an avid WSU Cougar fan, an accomplished cook, and an enthusiastic sportsman, and shared a special kinship with his father in their love of vintage cars. He enjoyed many wonderful days with his family and friends water-skiing and crabbing up at Camano Island, which he referred to as "Paradise".

Tragically, Brad died in a snowmobile accident near Lake Kachess, WA on December 19, 2003.
