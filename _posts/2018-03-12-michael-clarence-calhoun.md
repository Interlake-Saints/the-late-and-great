Mike was known for his profound love of his children and family, his good-natured personality, and his razor sharp wit. He made everyone around him laugh. He was a devoted father who enjoyed nothing more than spending time with his kids. His charisma and kindness made him close friends with many who will forever mourn his absence.

Mike is survived by two beloved sons, Braeden and Sam, his mother, Carol, his brother, Doug, and his sisters Katy and Karen. He was preceded in death by his sweet daughter, Claire, in 2013, who died at the age of 7.

Mike passed away suddenly from a heart attack on Monday, March 12, 2018.  He was 50 years old.
