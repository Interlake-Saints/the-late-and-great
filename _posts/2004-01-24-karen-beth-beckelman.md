Karen, aka Karen Beth White, married William A. White in Bellevue and they moved to the Warrenton area on July 1, 1990. She was a computer technician when she retired, and family members say she enjoyed playing the piano, ballroom dancing, and computers. They say she considered her children to be her greatest accomplishment. Her main interests were her friends and her church family.

Sadly, Karen passed away on January 24, 2004, in Astoria. She was 44 years old.
