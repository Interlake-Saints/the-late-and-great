Karie, aka Karie Jean Foo, died on March 16, 2008 in Overlake Hospital after a battle with pneumonia.

Sadly, Karie isn't the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older brother, [Stan](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1976/stanley-keith-jones/), is also listed, under the Class of 1976.
