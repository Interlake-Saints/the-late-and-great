Wendy was the registrar at Interlake, and she was also a key member in the grass roots development of the IHS Booster Club.  She was always an enthusiastic volunteer encouraging the involvement and success of our athletes.  She passed away in Bothell on January 10, 2001 after a three and a half year battle against ovarian cancer.  In Wendy's honor, a $1,000 scholarship is given away each year to one outstanding IHS scholar-athlete.
