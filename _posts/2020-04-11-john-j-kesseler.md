On Father’s Day of 2016, John received a diagnosis of Stage Two Pancreatic Cancer. He was 56, and his life changed forever. He eventually started the website Terminaljoy.com to document his journey and his thought process along the way. Sadly, John lost his battle with cancer on April 11, 2020. He passed peacefully holding his wife Janice's hand. John was a devout Christian man and has now joined his mother and many dear friends in Heaven.
