Steve suffered from periodic seizures throughout high school, presumably from irregular brain patterns caused by a head injury he had suffered in 3rd grade. On October 5th, 1989, he died in his sleep. He was 25. Just days before his death, Steve had passed his firefighters exam and was set to become a local firefighter.
