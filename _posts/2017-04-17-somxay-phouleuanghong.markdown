Somxay was driving to work early on the morning of April 14, 2017 when he was hit by a speeding car on West Valley Highway in Kent. He died in the hospital three days later, on April 17th.  He was 42 years old.  Afterwards, Somxay's friend Josh wrote a eulogy about his life which was read at Somxay's funeral.
