Beloved sister to Scott & Kelly Sumner. Awesome daughter to Gail & Gordon Sumner. Julie wanted to sail around the world before attending college.  She was on a trimaran journey with her boyfriend and future husband when they were hit by a South Seas typhoon just off the coast of Fiji, on March 27, 1979.  Her boyfriend survived the storm but Julie was never found afterwards. She was loved and missed by all.
