Amy had cystic fibrosis all throughout her childhood. She passed away a few years after high school, on December 11, 1984.

Sadly, Amy is not the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her sister, [Kelly](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1981/kelly-l-mallon/), is also listed, under the class of 1981.
