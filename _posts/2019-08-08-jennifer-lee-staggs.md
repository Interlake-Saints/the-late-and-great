Jennifer, beloved friend, partner, sister, jet-setter and eternal life of the party, passed away peacefully in her sleep on August 8, 2019. She was known to all for her infectious laughter, unbridled joy for life, and keen sense of irony. An established entrepreneur with a sharp intellect and uncanny instincts, she connected people and created opportunities wherever she went. Always accompanied by her beloved schipperke, Buddy, Jen was a heartful soul who was passionate about the environment, women’s rights, and all manner of animals in distress. She was only 48 years old.
