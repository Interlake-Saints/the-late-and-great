Maia, aka Maia Haykin, was singing while riding her bike in Bellingham's Boulevard Park on May 20, 2008, when she was hit by an Amtrak train. She died instantly. She was 49 years old. 

Her family later set up [a memorial guest book](https://www.legacy.com/guestbooks/bellinghamherald/guestbook-entry-print.aspx?n=maia-haykin&pid=110333448) dedicated to her life.

Maia's husband Rick wrote an amazing tribute to Maia in the days after she died, you can read it below in the comments.
