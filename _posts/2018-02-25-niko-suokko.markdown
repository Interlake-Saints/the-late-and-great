Niko was a ski instructor and a student at the International School who had just transferred to Interlake for his senior year. He and his friend Declan Ervin were snowshoeing near Alpental on February 25, 2018, when they were caught in an avalanche. Both of them were trapped in the snow and died. Niko was only 18 years old.
