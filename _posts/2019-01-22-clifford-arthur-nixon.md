Cliff Nixon was a well-loved teacher and coach, who coached track and cross country for five different Eastside schools in a career that spanned over six decades. His Interlake tenure lasted from 1986-1993, as he led seven different IHS teams to the Class AAA state meet in eight years. "We're in the world to make it a better place to live, and the first place to start is with people," he once said. "To make it a better world, you have to have better people. That's what coaching is all about." Cliff Nixon was inducted into the [Washington State Track and Field and Cross Country Hall of Fame in 1999](https://www.watfxc.com/1999-2/). Sadly, he passed away at the age of 82 on January 22, 2019.
