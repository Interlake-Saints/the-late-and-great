Stan was a dedicated employee for Boeing for thirty years. He also had the privilege of working for Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for the last five years of his life. He passed away surrounded by family on September 12, 2015.

Sadly, Stan isn't the only member of his family on the IHS Memorial Wall. His younger sister, [Karie](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1980/karie-jean-jones/), [](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1976/stanley-keith-jones/)is listed under the Class of 1980.
