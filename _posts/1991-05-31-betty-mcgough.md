Betty worked at Interlake from 1971 through 1977, first in the history department and then as the attendance secretary. She passed away on May 31, 1991 after a year long battle with cancer.

Sadly, Betty's children, [David McGough](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1974/david-raymond-mcgough/) and [Carol McGough](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1977/carol-j-mcgough/), are also listed on the IHS Memorial Wall, under the classes of 1974 and 1977, respectively.
