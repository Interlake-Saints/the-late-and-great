Amin played football at IHS, and was named the "best dressed" member of the class of 2000. He went on to get a business degree from UW and a Law Degree from Seattle U before taking a job as a lawyer in China. Unexpectedly, Amin died in his sleep in Shanghai on October 6, 2012, likely from an undetected heart defect. He was only 30 years old. 

Amin left behind a loving family and many heartbroken close friends. More details can be found [here](http://www.aminamirkia.org/), on a memorial website that was set up in his honor.
