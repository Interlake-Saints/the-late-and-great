Throughout his life, Paul enjoyed sports, X-Box, reading, and hanging out with friends. His family remembers him as a young man who brought so much joy to everyone he knew. He was smart, a deep thinker, hard-working and independent, yet goofy at times. For the past 18 months, Paul worked at Safeway. He will be remembered for his bright smile, kindness, and love of life.

Sadly, Paul passed away on September 12, 2013, just a few months after graduating high school. He was only 18 years old.
