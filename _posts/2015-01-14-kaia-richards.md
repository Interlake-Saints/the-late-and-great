Kaia was blessed with great creativity and was always making beautiful creations out of almost anything. She was also a great student with her teachers always commenting that she was a pleasure to have in class. Recently Kaia developed an interest in learning to play guitar and with hard work and dedication quickly progressed and gave several live performances.

Sadly, Kaia passed away on January 14th, 2015. She was only 16 years old.
