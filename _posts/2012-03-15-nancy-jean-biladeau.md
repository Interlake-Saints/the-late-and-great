Nancy graduated from Interlake through the special needs program in June of 1984. Shortly after graduation, she volunteered at a variety of work opportunities created for adults with disabilities. Also at that time she began a long time hobby with Bellevue School District’s Special Education Ski School, where she was in her glory winning medals galore at the Special Olympics.

Nancy was a beloved fixture in the Tam O’Shanter community where she resided. Her travels on the Metro bus system throughout the years in Crossroads, downtown Bellevue, Factoria, and her other favorite stomping grounds created many friendships and acquaintances. She was very proud of all that life offered her; her family, especially her nieces and nephews, her job, her church, her pets, and her maturing independence.

For nearly twenty-two years, Nancy worked as a steward at the Hyatt Regency in Bellevue, and would take daily trips by bus to the library and the mall. Tragically, she died on March 15, 2012, when the driver of her bus accidentally hit her as he was pulling away from the curb. She was 47 years old.
