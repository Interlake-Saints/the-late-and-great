Daniel was born on September 30th, 1967 in Redondo Beach, California. He was the youngest of eight born to Louis and Ralphlita Contreras. Dan lived the majority of his life in Bellevue, surrounded by his family. 

Dan revered fish. In their presence he found peace and tranquility. He loved fish so much that he never tasted a Pacific salmon. “Fish are my livelihood” he would say. Dan’s knowledge of fish was encyclopedic and self-taught. He designed, installed, and maintained some amazing tanks and koi ponds, both commercially and in private homes. In the end, Dan’s life was much like the water he so loved. His wave in the ocean took its shape, returned to the shore, and now has been pulled out to sea once again.

He died from a traumatic brain injury on February 9th, 2021.
