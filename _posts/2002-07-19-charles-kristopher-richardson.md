Kris, who was also known as Kris von Oy, was a talented artist and architect who created many of Seattle's hippest gathering places, including Bauhaus Books and Coffee, the Baltic Room and Caffe Vita on Capitol Hill, and the Alibi Room in Pike Place Market. He did everything from creating the logos and designing the interiors to swinging a hammer when construction time came. Sadly, he died in a one-car accident on West Magnolia Boulevard in Seattle on July 19, 2002. He was only 35 years old.
