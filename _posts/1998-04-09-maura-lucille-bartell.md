Maura, aka Maura L. Magnan, died on April 9, 1998 after a four year battle with breast cancer. She was 30 years old.

Sadly, Maura isn't the only member of her family on the IHS Memorial Wall. Her older sister, [Elizabeth](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1982/elizabeth-anne-bartell/), died of the exact same disease, seventeen years later. Elizabeth is listed under the Class of 1982.
