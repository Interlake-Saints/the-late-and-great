Erika died in a river rafting accident on July 27, 2004.  She was a senior honor student and a member of the cross country team at Principia College in Illinois at the time.  The school later constructed a gazebo in 2011 in her honor.  Erika was only 21 years old and, to this day, still holds at least one Principia track and field record.
