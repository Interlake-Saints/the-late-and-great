Troy Croshaw was an outstanding son, husband, brother, father, grocer, businessman, coach, neighbor, golf partner, and friend. Growing up, he played and loved all sports, and continued by coaching his own boys along with many others for the Redmond Parks Department, Redmond West Little League Baseball, and the Redmond Select Basketball program. Sadly, he passed away on December 16, 2007, after a courageous battle with kidney cancer, his devoted family at his side. He was 46.

Troy was an avid golfer, so after his death, his family and friends put together the yearly Troy Croshaw Memorial Golf Tournament to fund a scholarship named in his honor.
