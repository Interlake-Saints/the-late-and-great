Roy, aka Patrick R. McVey, met two men in Seattle's Volunteer Park on June 29, 1993.  He brought them back to his apartment at an Edmonds mini-storage facility, and they stabbed him.  He died a week later in the hospital, on July 6, 1993.  He was 31 years old. A story about the incident can be found [here](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930721&slug=1712087).

Sadly, Roy's younger brother, [Phil](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1983/phillip-phil-mcvey/), is also on the IHS Memorial Wall. Phil is listed under the Class of 1983.
