Paul played football in high school and never lost his passion for the sport. He was a season ticket holder with the Seahawks and never missed a game. His two children, Morgan and Jordan, were his pride and joy. He was an avid outdoorsman and spent much of his time at his tree farm in Alger, riding quads and building fires with his large extended family.

Paul suffered a stroke in June of 2019, and he spent many months in rehab recovering afterwards. He was doing very well in his recovery, he was getting better and better every day, and he had recently gotten engaged to be married to Leslie Baldwin, when he suddenly and unexpectedly died of heart failure on February 6, 2020. He is tremendously missed.
