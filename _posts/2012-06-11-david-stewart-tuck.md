David founded the Fresh Air Frisbee Team at Interlake, which was possibly the first competitive Frisbee team in the country. He later taught at several schools across eastern Washington, including Selkirk High School, Connell High School, McLoughlin Middle School where he was the 1991 Teacher of the Year, and Park Middle School. He finally settled at Southridge High School in Kennewick. David passed away suddenly on June 11, 2012. He was 59 years old.
