Iain's passion in life was golf. He graduated from the San Diego Golf Academy in 1994, and he was appointed Assistant Golf Professional at Aviara Golf Club in Carlsbad, CA. He continued in the Golf Retail and Equipment Testing businesses until he was diagnosed with cancer.

Sadly, Iain passed away on March 5, 2006 in La Jolla, CA after a 13-month battle with both melanoma and brain cancer. He was 40 years old.
