Born prematurely and not expected to survive, each day was viewed as a special gift. With that in mind, Missy lived her life with the goal of making the world a better place. She spent most of her career in corporate human resources, where she was employed by The Pillsbury Company, Kraft Foods and Daymon Worldwide, Inc. But Missy’s special passion was figure skating. Having learned to skate as a child, she later joined a synchronized skating team, and wound up competing regionally, nationally, and internationally. She later went on to gain pre-gold certification in adult ice dance. In 2014 Missy and her sister, Mindy, established The Mop Shop, which helps lower income families in the area who need cleaning supplies. They also established the Dalgarn Family Scholarship, which helps local young people afford an education. Missy passed away on Friday, July 12, 2019, with her brother and sister at her side. She was 66 years old.
