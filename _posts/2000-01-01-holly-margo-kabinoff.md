Hadassah ''Holly'' Kabinoff worked for many years at the University of Washington editing research publications. Sadly, she died in a house fire on January 1, 2000.

From her obituary in the Eastside Journal: "As a volunteer for the Humane Society, Holly Kabinoff was willing to take the sickest kittens into her home as a foster parent, even if it meant getting up every hour to give them medicine. Over the years she fell in love with four of them, who became permanent residents of her home on 151st Avenue Northeast in the Chevy Chase area. So when a fire broke out in her living room early New Year's morning, Kabinoff didn't run out the front door. She headed upstairs to rescue her cats and was overcome by smoke.

Fire investigators believe she had dozed off while using a fondue pot, which somehow started the fire, according to her brother and neighbors."
