Kirk died in a skydiving accident on July 23, 1978, the summer after his sophomore year, when both his parachutes malfunctioned over the Issaquah Parachute Center.  He was only 16 years old.  In honor of their son, Kirk's parents created a memorial page for him in the 1979 IHS yearbook, which you can see below.

Kirk's death later led to a lawsuit, Edison v. Reliable Life Insurance Company, which is still referenced in parachute accidents, even today. See comments at the bottom of the page for more info.

Sadly, Kirk is not the only member of his family on the IHS Memorial Wall. His sister, [Cass](https://ihsmemorial.org/class-of-1978/cathy-jean-edison/), is listed under the Class of 1978.
